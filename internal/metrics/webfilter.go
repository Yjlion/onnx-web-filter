// A package-level registry rather than one threaded through BuildProxyEngine:
// the producers (internal/proxy and its addons) and the consumer
// (internal/mgmtapi) share no wiring today, and plumbing a registry into
// every addon struct would be a large mechanical change whose only benefit -
// multiple independent registries - nothing here wants. The cost is that
// tests observing counters must account for other tests' increments, which
// the helpers below (Value/Count) make easy enough by diffing.
