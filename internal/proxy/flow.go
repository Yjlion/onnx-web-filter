// ResponseBody is always the full buffered response body (Response.Body is
// never populated - the pipeline reads and closes the real body once, up

// Two addons are front-end concerns rather than policy concerns, and both are

//
//   - proxy_auth challenges the client for proxy credentials. Over ICAP the
//     client is Squid, which does its own proxy authentication, and one ICAP
//     connection carries transactions for many different end users - so the
//     per-connection "already authenticated" bookkeeping keyed on
//     ClientConnID cannot mean anything. Left enabled it would 407 every
//     request the moment proxy auth is switched on.
//   - management_access redirects the management pseudo-domain to the
//     address the client reached this proxy on. Over ICAP that address is
//     the ICAP listener's, which is not an address the end user's browser
//     can reach.
//
// Everything else - policy routing, MITM control, URL filtering, DoH,
// SafeSearch, YouTube, both classifiers, request logging - is a policy
// decision and runs identically whichever front-end delivered the flow.
