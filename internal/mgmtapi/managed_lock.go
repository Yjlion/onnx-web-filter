// lock pushed by the EMM takes effect immediately without an engine
// restart, and so the gate cannot be bypassed through the very settings API
// it protects. The file is tiny and mutations are human-scale, so the read
// cost is irrelevant. A present-but-unreadable file fails closed: this gate
// exists to resist on-device tampering, and a corrupted lock file must not
// grant write access.
