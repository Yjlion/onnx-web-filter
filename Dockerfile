# Debian (the same glibc family as the runtime stage). ONNX Runtime itself
# and the models are downloaded at first run into the data volume. See

# nothing. Instead, letting config.BootstrapRuntimeFiles generate the file on
# first start gives 0.0.0.0 binds and *absolute* directory paths rooted at
# /data (it strips the trailing "config" component of --settings), which is
